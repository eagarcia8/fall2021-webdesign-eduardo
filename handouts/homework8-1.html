<p><em>Please make sure to fix previous homework assignments that this homework depends on. If these previous homework assignments are not completed, this homework cannot pass.</em></p>
<p>This homework follows the homework assignment 6-1. Make sure you have Homework 6-1 documents ready as the grade for the entire project is based on how well the planning reflects the actual website, that is to say if the planning looks different compared to the actual website the final project grade can be reduced or possibly fail Homework 8-1.<br>
Expect to dedicate about <strong>two to four hours</strong> to complete this homework!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a folder called <strong>portfolio-website</strong> inside of the projects folder. You will be placing all content from this homework assignment into this folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the first HTML file which will be the base for your web pages. This HTML file should be called <strong>base.html</strong>. Create a CSS file and call it <strong>styles.css</strong>. Link this CSS file to your base.html file. Focus on the design and structure of the <strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header">Header</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer">Footer</a> HTML elements</strong> in your base.html file. Create your <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav">Navigation</a> element as well. Do not worry about the Main HTML element just yet. Make sure to git add and commit after this step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you are completely satisfied with the base.html design, <strong>make a copy</strong> of this HTML file for each of your web pages. <strong>Rename each</strong> of these copies to their proper web page name. Remember that whatever your home page will be, it must be called <strong>index.html</strong>. Once you have an HTML file for each of your web pages, fill in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main">Main</a> HTML element for each of them. In the Main section of each web page, use IDs and Classes to avoid CSS conflicts with the other web pages. Git add and commit after this step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Format your text and images as <strong>described in the Homework 6-1 assignment</strong>. Git add and commit after this step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test all your links, test your HTML code with the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3 Validator</a>, and test your CSS code in the <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3 CSS Validator</a>. Fix any issues you find with the time you have left before submitting this homework assignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git add and commit all files. The message for this commit should be <strong>Portfolio Version 1.0</strong>. Push to your GitHub account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Add, commit, and push your repository by <strong>Wednesday October 20, 2021 11:59PM</strong></p>
