<p>For this homework, you will continue working on your Hobby Page project. Please make sure you have Homework3-1 ready. <strong>If you have received instructor notes about homework3-1, please make sure you fix those</strong> before moving on to homework4-1.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create an HTML file and name it “<strong>hobby.html</strong>”. Place this file in your <strong>homework</strong> folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write down in a sheet of paper or a text file what parts of your text from homework3-1 will use which HTML elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start copying and pasting your text into your HTML file. Use p, h1, h2, h3, a, ul, ol, and li HTML tags as you see fit, but please make sure they are being used properly (e.g. do not use h2 just to make the text bigger, h2 are generally for sub-sections of h1). <strong>Note that you are not limited to just these HTML elements</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of the web page, you will make a reference list that includes hyperlinks to resources, references, and image credits. If you already used your hyperlinks inside of your paragraphs, please put a copy of those hyperlinks in this list as well. This reference list is very similar to a reference list in an English essay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>There should be <strong>no CSS code</strong> in your HTML file! These will be added later in a separate homework with separate requirements.</p>
<p>There should be <strong>no images</strong> in your webpage! These will be added later in a separate homework with separate requirements.</p>
<h2 id="homework-submission">Homework Submission</h2>
<p>Make sure to use the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML Validator</a> to <strong>validate</strong> your HTML file! Errors will not be accepted for this homework. Please make sure to minimize or remove Warnings.</p>
