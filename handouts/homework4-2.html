<p>For this homework, you will create and collect images that will help your reader guide them through your instructions for your hobby.</p>
<h2 id="creating-three-photos">Creating Three Photos</h2>
<p>During the second paragraph of your hobby page you should have explained how to get started with your hobby and have provided instructions, possibly as a list. Read through your instructions and decide how an image can help you describe that step. Take at a minimum, three images with your camera, smartphone, or webcam. If you do not have these, please borrow one from your family or friends for this assignment. Keep the following tips in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you press the shutter button, you move the device and can potentially create a blurry photo. Use the timer function if your device has it, that way you have a few seconds to focus on not moving the device while it’s taking the photo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the image files are created, “zoom” into your image files and make sure that small details are not blurry, retake your photos if they are. Some older or budget devices will generally have blurry results because of the sensor, do your best in minimizing blur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putting your arm that’s holding the device on something solid can help with unwanted movement of the camera or device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about the angle of the photo. Test if having the photo at a lower or higher angle improves visualizing the subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example photos can be: A collection of starting tools and materials, completed or in-progress projects, and showing a complex process through a single photo or set of photos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="searching-for-three-images">Searching for Three Images</h2>
<p>You will also be searching for three images on the Internet to be used on your hobby web page. When searching for these images you will need to pay special attention to the <strong>license</strong> of that image. You cannot take an image, provide credits, and call it a day; you need written permission to use every image that is not yours. Image licenses can count as written permission based on what the license states.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the Copyright section (up to the Public Domain subsection) from <a href="https://getcarro.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-image-usage-rights/">The Ultimate Guide to Image Usage Rights</a> by Sarah Donaworth to get a basic idea of copyright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a basic understanding of copyright, find images that have their licensing and identify if you can use it for free for personal or commercial use. Make sure to save a link to the licensing term for future reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All images on <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">pexels.com</a> and <a href="https://pixabay.com/">pixabay.com</a> have a very open license agreement. Please read the license of these images to get a clear understanding of what you can and cannot do. If you cannot find images that help your hobby page, look for images on other websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally you can email or contact the author of the work to ask for permission to use an image if there is no image license, but because of the nature of this homework, you may get a response much later than the due date of this homework, so it is recommended against trying to contact the owner for permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please find <strong>at a minimum, three images</strong> found on the Internet that will help you describe your hobby.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a file “hobby_license.txt”.</li>
<li>Inside this file, type in the image file name</li>
<li>Below each image file name, paste in a link to the image license, or file name of the license file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="homework-submission">Homework Submission</h2>
<p>Make sure to place all files in a folder called “hobby_images” inside of your <strong>homework</strong> folder.</p>
<p>Add, commit, and push your repository by <strong>Wednesday 15, 2021 11:59PM</strong></p>
