<!-- This is NOT how you make an image element! -->
<!-- <img>myimage.jpg</img> -->

<!-- This is the CORRECT way of making an image element! -->
<!-- img is a SELF-CLOSING tag, it has no closing tag, it closes itself! -->
<!-- src is an attribute, attributes are ADDITIONAL pieces of information for an element. Attributes can ONLY go inside of the OPENING tag. -->

<!-- Example of a good alt description. -->
<img src="pexels-mikhail-nilov-6707632.jpg" alt="Fake golden leaves in a clear glass bottle on a dark wood table with a white background." />

<!-- Example of a bad alt description. The description is describing the FILE and not the CONTENTS of the file. -->
<img src="pexels-tatiana-syrikova-3932944.jpg" alt="A JPG image." />

<!-- Example of bad alt description. The description is assuming or suggesting something not related to the image. -->
<img src="pexels-ketut-subiyanto-4246101.jpg" alt="A person is planning to run away." title="A person is planning to run away." />
