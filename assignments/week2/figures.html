<h2>Figures</h2>

<!-- The figure element is usually used for "attaching" text to an image. Note the difference between the alt text and the figcaption text, they usually have different purposes. --> 
<figure>
    <img src="images/cell.jpeg" alt="A cross section of an animal cell with refereneces." />
    <figcaption>The mitochondria is the power house of the cell.</figcaption>
</figure>

this is out on its own.

<h2>Quotes and Blockquotes</h2>

<!-- The q is to quote text INLINE (similar to how text flows). -->
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Vel commodi dicta ut cupiditate <q>voluptatibus</q>, blanditiis "aliquid" distinctio excepturi sit doloribus eligendi sequi aut repellendus, veniam, beatae corporis modi aperiam ab.</p>


<!-- The blockquote is to quote text as BLOCK-LEVEL element, usually for quoting large amounts of text, or text that is not quoted within your own paragraphs/text. -->
<blockquote>
    <p>Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they’ll go through anything. You read and you’re pierced.</p>
</blockquote>



<!-- Lorem ipsum is placeholder text, to help a designer understand how text will look like without having authentic text. -->
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Repellat consectetur officia veritatis nam sequi facere ipsa beatae ea dolorum, et debitis quas, molestias inventore cupiditate harum neque eligendi, mollitia iste!</p>
