            flex-direction will tell the flexbox how to order the children AND which side of the flexbox the children start from.

                flex-basis is the "starting point" for child's width.

                flex-grow dictates how much of the free space the child can get. this unit is relative and similar to a ratio. The free space in the flexbox will be split up by the TOTAL amount of flex-grow units, and then will be assigned to the children.

                flex-shrink dictates how much width the child has to sacrifice in order to display within the allowed parent width. the unit is similar to flex-grow. Note that this does not work when the children are wrapped by flex-wrap.

                overflow: hidden says that if any children of the parent is outside of the parent container, that area is automatically hidden from view.
